# Introduction

traVRsal brings natural walking to VR. It is an engine on top of Unity for creating immersive, room-scale experiences utilizing impossible spaces and non-euclidean geometry. Using the SDK, anybody can now easily create such experiences.

* [Worlds Repository](https://github.com/WetzoldStudios/traVRsal-worlds) - See how existing worlds were built and reuse parts

# Roadmap

This is the very beginning, getting the initial creation and publishing flow established. A lot of features will now be built on top of this. More detailed plans and vision documents will be shared soon.

# Known Bugs & Limitations

This is an early alpha version to get feedback and steer the direction of future development. Many things are still rough around the edges. It will help tremendously if you report every error you encounter but also every feature you are missing to the Discord SDK channel.

* skyboxes are not visible through all portals (requires level design mitigation, background color is visible though)
* TextMeshPro is not yet visible through portals and will suddenly pop into view
* only very few nodes are available right now and your feedback will help to fill the gaps
* shaders need to support stencils to be visible through transitions
* transparent objects are not visible through transitions
* incorrect JSON files will cause the studio to become stuck
* custom interactions are not possible yet (only pre-made Button for now)
* audio is not assigned to correct mixer channels yet 
* objects needs to be marked "Enable Read/Write" at import, otherwise NavMesh will fail or might even result in crashes
